Bonsai Fuzzing is a fuzz-testing algorithm that generates concise test cases for software such as compilers. 

More details are described in the research paper found here (add link).

A copy of the ChocoPy grammar is included in this repository in the file `chocopy_grammar.pdf`. Example output corpuses of Bonsai Fuzzing can be found in `exampleCorpuses/`.

To rerun Bonsai Fuzzing, please see the instructions in `artifact/`.
